[Coder](https://coder.com) is a platform that enables organizations to provision development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed WireguardÂ® tunnel, and automatically shut down when not used to save on costs. Coder empowers engineering teams with the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads that best suit their needs.

## Features

- Define cloud development environments using Terraform
  - Deploy on EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, and more
- Automatically shutdown idle resources to optimize costs
- Onboard developers in seconds instead of days
- Enforce security and compliance policies at the infrastructure level

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started with Coder is to install it on your local machine and provision development environments using Docker. This method works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Step 1: Install Coder

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Start the Coder server

```shell
# Data is cached in ~/.cache/coder
coder server
```

### Step 3: Set up your first workspace

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Create your initial admin user
3. Add a Docker template
4. Provision your first workspace

## Install

The easiest way to install Coder is to use our
[install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux
and macOS. For Windows, use the latest `..._installer.exe` file from GitHub
Releases.

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them. Run the install script with `--help` for additional flags.

> See [install](https://coder.com/docs/install) for additional methods.

Once installed, you can start a production deployment with a single command:

```shell
# Automatically sets up an external access URL on *.try.coder.app
coder server

# Requires a PostgreSQL instance (version 13 or higher) and external access URL
coder server --postgres-url <url> --access-url <url>
```

Use `coder --help` to get a list of flags and environment variables. Use our [install guides](https://coder.com/docs/install) for a complete walkthrough.
